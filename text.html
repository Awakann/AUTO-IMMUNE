<h1><strong>INFIDELITY IS THE KILLER OF A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP</strong></h1>
<p><b>A cursed love,not meant to be but forced by time and circumstances.</b></p>
<p><i>Only the strong can withstand the test of time and test of loyalty.</i></I></p>
<h2><u>The emblem of christ is on the church, and christ disciple and all christians should have it</u></h2>
<p><s>And in all the silence, i found my voice and became the best i could be by working on myself and not trying to control what is beyond me</s></p>
<h1><small>The only way isnt always the easy way and everyone should know that!</small></h1>
<p><em>A sentence i may write, a poem i may conjure but a love i cant seem to fathom. crazy much!!!</em></p>
<p><sup>For the love of money is the root of all evil and thats not a lie.</sup> <sub>A lie can be fed and forced on humans and it will run for generations non end.</sub></p>
<h2>And on his deathbed he realized how much he missed living to survive and not really lived. <mark>Live while you are Alive!!!</mark></h2>
<p>My life has been full of wonders and Im confident to say i am living every moments and i choose happiness.<ins>Happiness is a choice,its not a destination but an inside decision</ins> <del>Happiness is a choice,its not a destination</del></p>
